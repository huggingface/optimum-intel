# Stable Diffusion

The script [`run_diffusion.py`](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum-intel/blob/main/examples/neural_compressor/text-to-image/run_diffusion.py)
allows us to apply different post-training quantization approaches (such as dynamic and static) using the [Intel Neural Compressor ](https://github.com/intel/neural-compressor) library for text to image tasks.

The following example applies post-training static quantization on a stable diffusion [model](https://huggingface.co/lambdalabs/sd-pokemon-diffusers)fine-tuned on PokÃ©mon. In this example, we only quantize the unet model which is the performance critical in the diffusion pipeline, the diffusion pipeline has four models: safety_checker, text_encoder, unet, vae.

### Ground Truth Images
In this case, we used FID metric to evaluate the model, so we should download [training datasets](https://huggingface.co/datasets/lambdalabs/pokemon-blip-captions) and choose one image to a directory(like "base_images").
>**Note:** In this case we used picture: [Ground_Truth_Image](https://datasets-server.huggingface.co/assets/lambdalabs/pokemon-blip-captions/--/lambdalabs--pokemon-blip-captions/train/14/image/image.jpg).

## Quantization
```bash
python run_diffusion_post_training.py \
    --model_name_or_path lambdalabs/sd-pokemon-diffusers \
    --apply_quantization \
    --quantization_approach dynamic \
    --verify_loading \
    --base_images base_images \ # The path of the ground truth pictures
    --input_text "a drawing of a gray and black dragon" \
    --calibration_text "a drawing of a green pokemon with red eyes" \ # The prompt to calibrate for static quantization
    --output_dir /tmp/diffusion_output
```

In order to apply dynamic or static, `quantization_approach` must be set to respectively `dynamic` or `static`.

The flag `--verify_loading` can be passed along to verify that the resulting quantized model can be loaded correctly.

The ground truth image:

<div align="left">
<img src=images/ground_truth.jpg width=40%/>
</div>

The image generated by original model(FID with ground truth: 333):

<div align="left">
<img src=images/fp32.png width=40%/>
</div>

The image generated by quantized UNet(FID with ground truth: 246):

<div align="left">
<img src=images/int8.png width=40%/>
</div>

## Performance
Original model
```bash
python run_diffusion_post_training.py \
    --model_name_or_path sd-pokemon-diffusers \
    --output_dir /tmp/diffusion_output \
    --base_images base_images \   # The path of the ground truth pictures
    --input_text "a drawing of a gray and black dragon" \
    --benchmark
```
The model with a quantized U-Net component
```bash
python run_diffusion_post_training.py \
    --model_name_or_path sd-pokemon-diffusers \
    --output_dir /tmp/diffusion_output \
    --base_images base_images \   # The path of the ground truth pictures
    --input_text "a drawing of a gray and black dragon" \
    --benchmark \
    --int8
```
