## Language generation

Based on the script [`run_generation.py`](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/main/examples/pytorch/text-generation/run_generation.py).

The original generation task only supported the PyTorch eager model. By calling the `TSModelForCausalLM` class, we can now support a TorchScript model for generation tasks.

This example also allows us to apply different quantization approaches (such as dynamic, static, The example applies post-training static quantization on a gptj model).

Example usage:
### apply_quantization with post-training static
```bash
python run_generation.py \
    --model_type=gptj \
    --model_name_or_path=EleutherAI/gpt-j-6b \
    --apply_quantization \
    --quantization_approach static\
    --smooth_quant \
    --smooth_quant_alpha 0.7
```

### Use JIT model and apply_quantization with post-training static
```bash
python run_generation.py \
    --model_type=gptj \
    --model_name_or_path=EleutherAI/gpt-j-6b \
    --apply_quantization \
    --quantization_approach static\
    --smooth_quant \
    --smooth_quant_alpha 0.7 \
    --jit
```
