model:
  name: bert
  framework: pytorch                                 # Mandatory: possible values are pytorch and pytorch_fx.

device: cpu

quantization:
  approach: post_training_dynamic_quant              # Mandatory: Quantization approach, default to dynamic quantization.

tuning:
  accuracy_criterion:
    relative: 0.05                                   # Optional. default value is relative, can also be set to absolute. this example allows relative accuracy loss: 5%.
  exit_policy:
    timeout: 0                                       # Optional: tuning timeout (seconds). default value is 0 which means early stop. combine with max_trials field to decide when to exit.
    max_trials: 4
  random_seed: 9527                                  # Optional: random seed for deterministic tuning.
