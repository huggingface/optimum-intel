# Optical Character Recognition

The script [`run_ocr.py`](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum-intel/blob/main/examples/neural_compressor/optical-character-recognition/run_ocr.py)
allows us to apply different quantization approaches (such as dynamic and static quantization) 
using the [Intel Neural Compressor ](https://github.com/intel/neural-compressor) library for optical character recognition tasks and [IAM](https://fki.tic.heia-fr.ch/databases/iam-handwriting-database) datasets.

Note that this case is from https://github.com/NielsRogge/Transformers-Tutorials/blob/master/TrOCR/Evaluating_TrOCR_base_handwritten_on_the_IAM_test_set.ipynb, And it only support TrOCR models.

## Prepare datasets
```bash
wget https://layoutlm.blob.core.windows.net/trocr/dataset/IAM.tar.gz
tar xvf IAM.tar.gz
```

## Run Command
The following example applies post-training static quantization on TrOCR small fine-tuned on the IAM dataset. This tuning process will take a long time. If you want to get a quantized model quickly, but do not care about the accuracy, you can set --tolerance_criterion larger or --max_eval_samples small. The default value of tolerance_criterion is 0.01, and max_eval_samples is None(None means the entire datasets).
```bash
python run_ocr_post_training.py \
    --model_name_or_path microsoft/trocr-small-handwritten \
    --datasets_dir IAM \
    --apply_quantization \
    --quantization_approach dynamic \
    --verify_loading \
    --output_dir /tmp/trocr_output
```

In order to apply dynamic and static quantization, `quantization_approach` must be set to respectively `dynamic` or `static`.

The flag `--verify_loading` can be passed along to verify that the resulting quantized model can be loaded correctly.
