# Language modeling training

The scripts [`run_clm.py`](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum-intel/blob/main/examples/neural_compressor/language-modeling/run_clm.py) 
and [`run_mlm.py`](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum-intel/blob/main/examples/neural_compressor/language-modeling/run_mlm.py)
allow us to apply different quantization approaches (such as dynamic, static and aware-training quantization) as well as pruning 
using the [Intel Neural Compressor ](https://github.com/intel/neural-compressor) library for language modeling tasks.

For pruning, we support snip_momentum(default), snip_momentum_progressive, magnitude, magnitude_progressive, gradient, gradient_progressive, snip, snip_progressive and pattern_lock. You can refer to [the pruning details](https://github.com/intel/neural-compressor/tree/master/neural_compressor/pruner#pruning-types).

> **_Note:_** At present, neural_compressor only support to prune linear and conv ops. So if we set a target sparsity is 0.9, it means that the pruning op's sparsity will be 0.9, not the whole model's sparsity is 0.9. For example: the embedding ops will not be pruned in the model.


GPT and GPT-2 are trained or fine-tuned using a causal language modeling (CLM) loss. ALBERT, BERT, DistilBERT and 
RoBERTa are trained or fine-tuned using a masked language modeling (MLM) loss, more information about the differences 
between those objectives can be found in our [model summary](https://huggingface.co/transformers/model_summary.html).


### GPT-2/GPT and causal language modeling

The following example fine-tunes GPT-Neo on WikiText-2 while first applying snip_momentum pruning and then quantization aware training.
We're using the raw WikiText-2 (no tokens were replaced before the tokenization). The loss here is that of causal language modeling (CLM). 

```bash
python run_clm.py \
    --model_name_or_path EleutherAI/gpt-neo-125M \
    --dataset_name wikitext \
    --dataset_config_name wikitext-2-raw-v1 \
    --apply_quantization \
    --quantization_approach aware_training \
    --apply_pruning \
    --target_sparsity 0.02 \
    --num_train_epochs 4 \
    --max_train_samples 100 \
    --do_train \
    --do_eval \
    --verify_loading \
    --output_dir /tmp/clm_output
```

### RoBERTa/BERT/DistilBERT and masked language modeling

The following example fine-tunes RoBERTa on WikiText-2 while applying quantization aware training and snip_momentum pruning. We're using the raw 
WikiText-2. The loss is different as BERT/RoBERTa have a bidirectional mechanism, we are therefore using the same loss 
that was used during their pre-training: masked language modeling (MLM) loss. 

```bash
python run_mlm.py \
    --model_name_or_path bert-base-uncased \
    --dataset_name wikitext \
    --dataset_config_name wikitext-2-raw-v1 \
    --apply_quantization \
    --quantization_approach aware_training \
    --apply_pruning \
    --target_sparsity 0.02 \
    --num_train_epochs 4 \
    --max_train_samples 100 \
    --do_train \
    --do_eval \
    --verify_loading \
    --output_dir /tmp/mlm_output
```

In order to apply dynamic, static or aware-training quantization, `quantization_approach` must be set to 
respectively `dynamic`, `static` or `aware_training`.

The flag `--verify_loading` can be passed along to verify that the resulting quantized model can be loaded correctly.
