# Question answering

This folder contains [`run_qa.py`](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum/blob/main/examples/openvino/question-answering/run_qa.py), a script to fine-tune a ðŸ¤— Transformers model on a question answering dataset while applying quantization aware training (QAT). QAT can be easily applied by replacing the Transformers [`Trainer`](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/main_classes/trainer#trainer) with the Optimum [`OVTrainer`].
An `QuestionAnsweringOVTrainer` is defined in [`trainer_qa.py`](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum/blob/main/examples/openvino/question-answering/trainer_qa.py), which inherits from `OVTrainer` and is adapted to perform question answering tasks evaluation.

Any model from our [hub](https://huggingface.co/models) (as long as the model supported by the [`AutoModelForQuestionAnswering`](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/model_doc/auto#transformers.AutoModelForQuestionAnswering) API) can be fine-tuned on a question-answering dataset (such as SQuAD, or any other QA dataset available in the `datasets` library, or your own csv/jsonlines files) as long as they are structured the same way as SQuAD. You might need to tweak the data processing inside the script if your data is structured differently.

**Note:** This script only works with models that have a fast tokenizer (backed by the ðŸ¤— Tokenizers library) as it
uses special features of those tokenizers. You can check if your favorite model has a fast tokenizer in
[this table](https://huggingface.co/transformers/index.html#supported-frameworks).

Note that if your dataset contains samples with no possible answers (like SQuAD version 2), you need to pass along the flag `--version_2_with_negative`.

### Fine-tuning BERT on SQuAD1.0

Here we show how to apply quantization aware training (QAT) on a fine-tuned DistilBERT on the SQuAD1.0 dataset.

```bash
python run_qa.py \
  --model_name_or_path distilbert-base-uncased-distilled-squad \
  --dataset_name squad \
  --do_train \
  --do_eval \
  --per_device_train_batch_size 8 \
  --per_device_eval_batch_size 8 \
  --max_train_samples 1024 \
  --learning_rate 3e-5 \
  --num_train_epochs 1 \
  --max_seq_length 384 \
  --doc_stride 128 \
  --output_dir /tmp/outputs_squad/
```
