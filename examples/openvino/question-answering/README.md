# Question answering

This folder contains [`run_qa.py`](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum/blob/main/examples/openvino/question-answering/run_qa.py), a script to fine-tune a ðŸ¤— Transformers model on a question answering dataset while applying quantization aware training (QAT). QAT can be easily applied by replacing the Transformers [`Trainer`](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/main_classes/trainer#trainer) with the Optimum [`OVTrainer`].
An `QuestionAnsweringOVTrainer` is defined in [`trainer_qa.py`](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum/blob/main/examples/openvino/question-answering/trainer_qa.py), which inherits from `OVTrainer` and is adapted to perform question answering tasks evaluation.

Any model from our [hub](https://huggingface.co/models) (as long as the model supported by the [`AutoModelForQuestionAnswering`](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/model_doc/auto#transformers.AutoModelForQuestionAnswering) API) can be fine-tuned on a question-answering dataset (such as SQuAD, or any other QA dataset available in the `datasets` library, or your own csv/jsonlines files) as long as they are structured the same way as SQuAD. You might need to tweak the data processing inside the script if your data is structured differently.

**Note:** This script only works with models that have a fast tokenizer (backed by the ðŸ¤— Tokenizers library) as it
uses special features of those tokenizers. You can check if your favorite model has a fast tokenizer in
[this table](https://huggingface.co/transformers/index.html#supported-frameworks).

Note that if your dataset contains samples with no possible answers (like SQuAD version 2), you need to pass along the flag `--version_2_with_negative`.

### Fine-tuning BERT on SQuAD1.0

Here we show how to apply quantization aware training (QAT) on a fine-tuned DistilBERT on the SQuAD1.0 dataset.

```bash
python run_qa.py \
  --model_name_or_path distilbert-base-uncased-distilled-squad \
  --dataset_name squad \
  --do_train \
  --do_eval \
  --per_device_train_batch_size 8 \
  --per_device_eval_batch_size 8 \
  --max_train_samples 1024 \
  --learning_rate 3e-5 \
  --num_train_epochs 1 \
  --max_seq_length 384 \
  --doc_stride 128 \
  --output_dir /tmp/outputs_squad/
```

### Joint Pruning, Quantization and Distillation (JPQD) for BERT on SQuAD1.0
`OVTrainer` also provides an advanced optimization workflow through the NNCF when Transformer model can be structurally pruned along with 8-bit quantization and distillation. Below is an example which demonstrates how to jointly prune, quantize BERT-base for SQuAD 1.0 using NNCF config `--nncf_compression_config` and distill from BERT-large teacher. This example closely resembles the movement sparsification work of [Lagunas et al., 2021, Block Pruning For Faster Transformers](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.04838.pdf). This example takes about 12 hours with a single V100 GPU and ~40% of the weights of the Transformer blocks were pruned.

More on how to configure movement sparsity, see NNCF documentation [here](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/nncf/blob/develop/nncf/experimental/torch/sparsity/movement/MovementSparsity.md).

To run the JPQD example, please install optimum-intel from source. This command will install or upgrade optimum-intel and all necessary dependencies:

```python -m pip install --upgrade "git+https://github.com/huggingface/optimum-intel.git#egg=optimum-intel[openvino, nncf]"
```

```bash
python run_qa.py \
    --model_name_or_path bert-base-uncased \
    --dataset_name squad \
    --teacher_model_or_path bert-large-uncased-whole-word-masking-finetuned-squad \
    --distillation_weight 0.9 \
    --do_eval \
    --fp16 \
    --do_train \
    --learning_rate 3e-5 \
    --num_train_epochs 8 \
    --per_device_eval_batch_size 128 \
    --per_device_train_batch_size 16 \
    --max_seq_length 384 \
    --doc_stride 128 \
    --logging_steps 1 \
    --evaluation_strategy steps \
    --eval_steps 250 \
    --save_steps 500 \
    --save_total_limit 5 \
    --output_dir /tmp/jpqd_bert_squad/ \
    --overwrite_output_dir \
    --nncf_compression_config configs/bert-base-jpqd.json
```
