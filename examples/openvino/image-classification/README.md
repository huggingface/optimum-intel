# Image classification

This folder contains [`run_image_classification.py`](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum/blob/main/examples/openvino/image-classification/run_image_classification.py), a script to fine-tune a ðŸ¤— Transformers model on an image classification dataset while applying quantization aware training (QAT). QAT can be easily applied by replacing the Transformers [`Trainer`](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/main_classes/trainer#trainer) with the Optimum [`OVTrainer`]. Any model from our [hub](https://huggingface.co/models) can be fine-tuned and quantized, as long as the model is supported by the [`AutoModelForImageClassification`](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/model_doc/auto#transformers.AutoModelForImageClassification) API.

### Fine-tuning ViT on the beans dataset

Here we show how to apply quantization aware training (QAT) on a fine-tuned Vision Transformer (ViT) on the beans dataset (to classify the disease type of bean leaves).

```bash
python run_image_classification.py \
    --model_name_or_path nateraw/vit-base-beans \
    --dataset_name beans \
    --remove_unused_columns False \
    --do_train \
    --do_eval \
    --learning_rate 2e-5 \
    --num_train_epochs 1 \
    --per_device_train_batch_size 8 \
    --per_device_eval_batch_size 8 \
    --logging_strategy steps \
    --logging_steps 10 \
    --evaluation_strategy epoch \
    --save_strategy epoch \
    --save_total_limit 3 \
    --seed 1337 \
    --output_dir /tmp/beans_outputs/
