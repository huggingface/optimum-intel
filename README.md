# Optimum Intel

ðŸ¤— Optimum Intel is the interface between the ðŸ¤— Transformers library and the different tools and libraries provided by Intel to accelerate end-to-end pipelines on Intel architectures.

Intel [Neural Compressor](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/oneapi/neural-compressor.html) is an open-source library enabling the usage of the most popular compression techniques such as quantization, pruning and knowledge distillation. It supports automatic accuracy-driven tuning strategies in order for users to easily generate quantized model. The users can easily apply static, dynamic and aware-training quantization approaches while giving an expected accuracy criteria. It also supports different weight pruning techniques enabling the creation of pruned model giving a predefined sparsity target.

[OpenVINO](https://docs.openvino.ai/latest/index.html) is an open-source toolkit enabling model optimization and providing high-performance inference solutions for XPUs including various types of CPUs, GPUs, and special DL inference accelerators.

## Install

ðŸ¤— Optimum Intel can be installed using `pip` as follows:

```bash
python -m pip install optimum[intel]
```

Optimum Intel is a fast-moving project, and you may want to install from source.

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/optimum-intel.git
```

To install the latest release of this package with the corresponding required dependencies, you can do respectively:
| Accelerator | Installation |
|:------------|:---------------------------------------------|
| [OpenVINO](https://docs.openvino.ai/latest/index.html)| `python -m pip install optimum-intel[openvino]` |
| Intel [Neural Compressor](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/oneapi/neural-compressor.html) | `python -m pip install optimum-intel[neural-compressor]`|

## Running the examples

There are a number of examples provided in the `examples` directory.

Please install the requirements for every example:

```
cd <example-folder>
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to use it?

### Neural Compressor

Here is an example on how to apply dynamic quantization on a DistilBERT fine-tuned on the SQuAD1.0 dataset.
Note that quantization is currently only supported for CPUs (only CPU backends are available), so we will not be utilizing GPUs / CUDA in this example.

```python
from datasets import load_dataset
from transformers import AutoModelForQuestionAnswering, AutoTokenizer, pipeline
from evaluate import evaluator
from optimum.intel.neural_compressor import IncOptimizer, IncQuantizationConfig, IncQuantizer

model_id = "distilbert-base-cased-distilled-squad"
model = AutoModelForQuestionAnswering.from_pretrained(model_id)
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_id)
eval_dataset = load_dataset("squad", split="validation").select(range(20))
eval = evaluator("question-answering")
qa_pipeline = pipeline("question-answering", model=model, tokenizer=tokenizer)

def eval_func(model):
    qa_pipeline.model = model
    metrics = eval.compute(model_or_pipeline=qa_pipeline, data=eval_dataset, metric="squad")
    return metrics["f1"]

# Load the quantization configuration detailing the quantization we wish to apply
config_path = "echarlaix/distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english-int8-dynamic"
quantization_config = IncQuantizationConfig.from_pretrained(config_path)

# Instantiate our IncQuantizer using the desired configuration and the evaluation function used
# for the INC accuracy-driven tuning strategy
quantizer = IncQuantizer(quantization_config, eval_func=eval_func)
optimizer = IncOptimizer(model, quantizer=quantizer)

# Apply dynamic quantization
quantized_model = optimizer.fit()

# Save the resulting model and its corresponding configuration in the given directory
optimizer.save_pretrained("./quantized_model")
```

To load a quantized model hosted locally or on the ðŸ¤— hub, you can do as follows :
```python
from optimum.intel.neural_compressor.quantization import IncQuantizedModelForSequenceClassification

loaded_model_from_hub = IncQuantizedModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(
    "Intel/distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english-int8-dynamic"
)
```

You can load many more quantized models hosted on the hub under the Intel organization [`here`](https://huggingface.co/Intel).

Check out the [`examples`](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum-intel/tree/main/examples) directory for more sophisticated usage.

### OpenVINO

Here is an example on how to perform inference with OpenVINO Runtime:

```diff
-from transformers import AutoModelForSequenceClassification
+from optimum.intel.openvino import OVModelForSequenceClassification
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, pipeline

model_id = "distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english"
-model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(model_id)
+model = OVModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(model_id, from_transformers=True)
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_id)
pipe_cls = pipeline("text-classification", model=model, tokenizer=tokenizer)
text = "He's a dreadful magician."
outputs = pipe_cls(text)
```
