    "# Quantize a Hugging Face Question-Answering Model with OpenVINO\n",

    "This notebook shows how to quantize a question answering model with OpenVINO's [Neural Network Compression Framework](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/nncf) (NNCF). \n",
    "\n",
    "With quantization, we reduce the precision of the model's weights and activations from floating point (FP32) to integer (INT8). This results in a smaller model with faster inference times with OpenVINO Runtime. \n",

    "The notebook demonstrates post-training quantization, which does not require specific hardware to execute. A laptop or desktop with a recent Intel Core processor is recommended for best results. To install the requirements for this notebook, please do `pip install -r requirements.txt` or uncomment the cell below to install the requirements in your current Python environment."

Kony Ealy tied a Super Bowl record with three sacks. Jordan Norwood's 61-yard punt return set a new record, surpassing the old record of 45 yards set by John Taylor in Super Bowl XXIII. Denver was just 1-of-14 on third down, while Carolina was barely better at 3-of-15. The two teams' combined third down conversion percentage of 13.8 was a Super Bowl low. Manning and Newton had quarterback passer ratings of 56.6 and 55.4, respectively, and their added total of 112 is a record lowest aggregate passer rating for a Super Bowl. Manning became the oldest quarterback ever to win a Super Bowl at age 39, and the first quarterback ever to win a Super Bowl with two different teams, while Gary Kubiak became the first head coach to win a Super Bowl with the same franchise he went to the Super Bowl with as a player.\n"
