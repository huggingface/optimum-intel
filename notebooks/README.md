# ðŸ¤— Optimum Intel Notebooks
ðŸ¤—[Optimum Intel](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum-intel)  is the interface between the ðŸ¤— [Transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) library and the different tools and libraries provided by Intel to accelerate end-to-end pipelines on Intel architectures.

You can find here a list of the notebooks, leveraging the usage of the Optimum Intel library for different tools and libraries provided by Intel.
