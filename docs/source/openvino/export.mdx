# Export your model

To export a [model](https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum/main/en/intel/openvino/models) hosted on the [Hub](https://huggingface.co/models) you can use our [space](https://huggingface.co/spaces/echarlaix/openvino-export). After conversion, a repository will be pushed under your namespace, this repository can be either public or private.

## Using the CLI

To export your model to the [OpenVINO IR](https://docs.openvino.ai/2024/documentation/openvino-ir-format.html) format with the CLI :

```bash
optimum-cli export openvino --model meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B ov_model/
```

To export a private model or a model that requires access, you can either run `huggingface-cli login` to log in permanently, or set the environment variable `HF_TOKEN` to a [token](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens) with access to the model. See the [authentication documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/huggingface_hub/quick-start#authentication) for more information.

The model argument can either be the model ID of a model hosted on the [Hub](https://huggingface.co/models) or a path to a model hosted locally. For local models, you need to specify the task for which the model should be loaded before export, among the list of the [supported tasks](https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum/main/en/exporters/task_manager).

```bash
optimum-cli export openvino --model local_llama --task text-generation-with-past ov_model/
```

  output                Path indicating the directory where to store the generated OV model.

Optional arguments:
  --task TASK           The task to export the model for. If not specified, the task will be auto-inferred based on
                        the model. Available tasks depend on the model, but are among: ['image-to-image',
                        'image-segmentation', 'inpainting', 'sentence-similarity', 'text-to-audio', 'image-to-text',
                        'automatic-speech-recognition', 'token-classification', 'text-to-image', 'audio-classification',
                        'feature-extraction', 'semantic-segmentation', 'masked-im', 'audio-xvector',
                        'audio-frame-classification', 'text2text-generation', 'multiple-choice', 'depth-estimation',
                        'image-classification', 'fill-mask', 'zero-shot-object-detection', 'object-detection',
                        'question-answering', 'zero-shot-image-classification', 'mask-generation', 'text-generation',
                        'text-classification']. For decoder models, use 'xxx-with-past' to export the model using past
                        key values in the decoder.
  --framework {pt}   The framework to use for the export. Defaults to 'pt' for PyTorch.
  --trust-remote-code   Allows to use custom code for the modeling hosted in the model repository. This option should
                        only be set for repositories you trust and in which you have read the code, as it will execute
                        on your local machine arbitrary code present in the model repository.
  --weight-format {fp32,fp16,int8,int4,mxfp4,nf4,cb4}
                        The weight format of the exported model. Option 'cb4' represents a codebook with 16
                        fixed fp8 values in E4M3 format.
  --quant-mode {int8,f8e4m3,f8e5m2,nf4_f8e4m3,nf4_f8e5m2,cb4_f8e4m3,int4_f8e4m3,int4_f8e5m2}
                        Quantization precision mode. This is used for applying full model quantization including
                        activations.
  --library {transformers,diffusers,timm,sentence_transformers,open_clip}
                        The library used to load the model before export. If not provided, will attempt to infer the
                        local checkpoint's library
  --cache_dir CACHE_DIR
                        The path to a directory in which the downloaded model should be cached if the standard cache
                        should not be used.
  --pad-token-id PAD_TOKEN_ID
                        This is needed by some models, for some tasks. If not provided, will attempt to use the
                        tokenizer to guess it.
  --ratio RATIO         A parameter used when applying 4-bit quantization to control the ratio between 4-bit and 8-bit
                        quantization. If set to 0.8, 80% of the layers will be quantized to int4 while 20% will be
                        quantized to int8. This helps to achieve better accuracy at the sacrifice of the model size
                        and inference latency. Default value is 1.0. Note: If dataset is provided, and the ratio is
                        less than 1.0, then data-aware mixed precision assignment will be applied.
  --sym                 Whether to apply symmetric quantization. This argument is related to integer-typed
                        --weight-format and --quant-mode options. In case of full or mixed quantization (--quant-mode)
                        symmetric quantization will be applied to weights in any case, so only activation quantization
                        will be affected by --sym argument. For weight-only quantization (--weight-format) --sym
                        argument does not affect backup precision. Examples: (1) --weight-format int8 --sym => int8
                        symmetric quantization of weights; (2) --weight-format int4 => int4 asymmetric quantization of
                        weights; (3) --weight-format int4 --sym --backup-precision int8_asym => int4 symmetric
                        quantization of weights with int8 asymmetric backup precision; (4) --quant-mode int8 --sym =>
                        weights and activations are quantized to int8 symmetric data type; (5) --quant-mode int8 =>
                        activations are quantized to int8 asymmetric data type, weights -- to int8 symmetric data type;
                        (6) --quant-mode int4_f8e5m2 --sym => activations are quantized to f8e5m2 data type, weights --
                        to int4 symmetric data type.
  --group-size GROUP_SIZE
                        The group size to use for quantization. Recommended value is 128 and -1 uses per-column
                        quantization.
  --backup-precision {none,int8_sym,int8_asym}
                        Defines a backup precision for mixed-precision weight compression. Only valid for 4-bit weight
                        formats. If not provided, backup precision is int8_asym. 'none' stands for original floating-
                        point precision of the model weights, in this case weights are retained in their original
                        precision without any quantization. 'int8_sym' stands for 8-bit integer symmetric quantization
                        without zero point. 'int8_asym' stands for 8-bit integer asymmetric quantization with zero
                        points per each quantization group.
  --dataset DATASET     The dataset used for data-aware compression or quantization with NNCF. For language models you
                        can use the one from the list ['auto','wikitext2','c4','c4-new']. With 'auto' the dataset will
                        be collected from model's generations. For diffusion models it should be on of
                        ['conceptual_captions','laion/220k-GPT4Vision-captions-from-LIVIS','laion/filtered-wit']. For
                        visual language models the dataset must be set to 'contextual'. Note: if none of the data-aware
                        compression algorithms are selected and ratio parameter is omitted or equals 1.0, the dataset
                        argument will not have an effect on the resulting model. Note: for text generation task,
                        datasets with English texts such as 'wikitext2','c4' or 'c4-new' usually work fine even for
                        non-English models.
  --all-layers          Whether embeddings and last MatMul layers should be compressed to INT4. If not provided an
                        weight compression is applied, they are compressed to INT8.
  --awq                 Whether to apply AWQ algorithm. AWQ improves generation quality of INT4-compressed LLMs. If
                        dataset is provided, a data-aware activation-based version of the algorithm will be executed,
                        which requires additional time. Otherwise, data-free AWQ will be applied which relies on
                        per-column magnitudes of weights instead of activations. Note: it is possible that there will
                        be no matching patterns in the model to apply AWQ, in such case it will be skipped.
  --scale-estimation    Indicates whether to apply a scale estimation algorithm that minimizes the L2 error between
                        the original and compressed layers. Providing a dataset is required to run scale estimation.
                        Please note, that applying scale estimation takes additional memory and time.
  --gptq                Indicates whether to apply GPTQ algorithm that optimizes compressed weights in a layer-wise
                        fashion to minimize the difference between activations of a compressed and original layer.
                        Please note, that applying GPTQ takes additional memory and time.
  --lora-correction     Indicates whether to apply LoRA Correction algorithm. When enabled, this algorithm introduces
                        low-rank adaptation layers in the model that can recover accuracy after weight compression at
                        some cost of inference latency. Please note, that applying LoRA Correction algorithm takes
                        additional memory and time.
  --sensitivity-metric SENSITIVITY_METRIC
                        The sensitivity metric for assigning quantization precision to layers. It can be one of the
                        following: ['weight_quantization_error', 'hessian_input_activation',
                        'mean_activation_variance', 'max_activation_variance', 'mean_activation_magnitude'].
  --quantization-statistics-path QUANTIZATION_STATISTICS_PATH
                        Directory path to dump/load data-aware weight-only quantization statistics. This is useful when
                        running data-aware quantization multiple times on the same model and dataset to avoid
                        recomputing statistics. This option is applicable exclusively for weight-only quantization.
                        Please note that the statistics depend on the dataset, so if you change the dataset, you should
                        also change the statistics path to avoid confusion.
  --num-samples NUM_SAMPLES
                        The maximum number of samples to take from the dataset for quantization.
  --disable-stateful    Disable stateful converted models, stateless models will be generated instead. Stateful models
                        are produced by default when this key is not used. In stateful models all kv-cache inputs and
                        outputs are hidden in the model and are not exposed as model inputs and outputs. If --disable-
                        stateful option is used, it may result in sub-optimal inference performance. Use it when you
                        intentionally want to use a stateless model, for example, to be compatible with existing
                        OpenVINO native inference code that expects KV-cache inputs and outputs in the model.
  --disable-convert-tokenizer
                        Do not add converted tokenizer and detokenizer OpenVINO models.
  --smooth-quant-alpha SMOOTH_QUANT_ALPHA
                        SmoothQuant alpha parameter that improves the distribution of activations before MatMul layers
                        and reduces quantization error. Valid only when activations quantization is enabled.
```

You can also apply fp16, 8-bit or 4-bit weight-only quantization on the Linear, Convolutional and Embedding layers when exporting your model by setting `--weight-format` to respectively `fp16`, `int8` or `int4`.

Export with INT8 weights compression:
```bash
optimum-cli export openvino --model meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B --weight-format int8 ov_model/
```

Export with INT4 weights compression:
```bash
optimum-cli export openvino --model meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B --weight-format int4 ov_model/
```

Export with INT4 weights compression and data-free AWQ algorithm:
```bash
optimum-cli export openvino --model meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B --weight-format int4 --awq ov_model/
```

Export with INT4 weights compression and data-aware AWQ and Scale Estimation algorithms:
```bash
optimum-cli export openvino --model meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B \
    --weight-format int4 --awq --scale-estimation --dataset wikitext2 ov_model/
```

For more information on the quantization parameters checkout the [documentation](inference#weight-only-quantization)


<Tip warning={true}>

Models larger than 1 billion parameters are exported to the OpenVINO format with 8-bit weights by default. You can disable it with `--weight-format fp32`.

</Tip>


Besides weight-only quantization, you can also apply full model quantization including activations by setting `--quant-mode` to preferred precision. This will quantize both weights and activations of Linear, Convolutional and some other layers to selected mode. Please see example below.

```bash
optimum-cli export openvino -m openai/whisper-large-v3-turbo --quant-mode int8 --dataset librispeech --num-samples 32 --smooth-quant-alpha 0.9 ./whisper-large-v3-turbo
```

#### Default quantization configs

For some models we maintain a set of default quantization configs ([link](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum-intel/blob/main/optimum/intel/openvino/configuration.py)). To apply a default 4-bit weight-only quantization one should provide `--weight-format int4` without any additional arguments. For int8 weight & activation quantization it should be `--quant-mode int8`. For example:

```bash
optimum-cli export openvino -m microsoft/Phi-4-mini-instruct --weight-format int4 ./Phi-4-mini-instruct
```

or

```bash
optimum-cli export openvino -m openai/clip-vit-base-patch16 --quant-mode int8 ./clip-vit-base-patch16
```


### Decoder models

For models with a decoder, we enable the re-use of past keys and values by default. This allows to avoid recomputing the same intermediate activations at each generation step. To export the model without, you will need to remove the `-with-past` suffix when specifying the task.

| With K-V cache                           | Without K-V cache                    |
|------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| `text-generation-with-past`              | `text-generation`                    |
| `text2text-generation-with-past`         | `text2text-generation`               |
| `automatic-speech-recognition-with-past` | `automatic-speech-recognition`       |


### Diffusion models

When Stable Diffusion models are exported to the OpenVINO format, they are decomposed into different components that are later combined during inference:

* Text encoder(s)
* U-Net
* VAE encoder
* VAE decoder

To export your Stable Diffusion XL model to the OpenVINO IR format with the CLI you can do as follows:

```bash
optimum-cli export openvino --model stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-base-1.0 ov_sdxl/
```

You can also apply hybrid quantization during model export. For example:
```bash
optimum-cli export openvino --model stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-base-1.0 \
    --weight-format int8 --dataset conceptual_captions ov_sdxl/
```

For more information about hybrid quantization, take a look at this jupyter [notebook](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum-intel/blob/main/notebooks/openvino/stable_diffusion_hybrid_quantization.ipynb).

## When loading your model

You can also load your PyTorch checkpoint and convert it to the OpenVINO format on-the-fly, by setting `export=True` when loading your model.

To easily save the resulting model, you can use the `save_pretrained()` method, which will save both the BIN and XML files describing the graph. It is useful to save the tokenizer to the same directory, to enable easy loading of the tokenizer for the model.


```diff
- from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM
+ from optimum.intel import OVModelForCausalLM
  from transformers import AutoTokenizer

  model_id = "meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B"
- model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_id)
+ model = OVModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_id, export=True)
  tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_id)

  save_directory = "ov_model"
  model.save_pretrained(save_directory)
  tokenizer.save_pretrained(save_directory)
```

## After loading your model

```python
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM
from optimum.exporters.openvino import export_from_model

model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B")
export_from_model(model, output="ov_model", task="text-generation-with-past")
```

Once the model is exported, you can now [load your OpenVINO model](inference) by replacing the `AutoModelForXxx` class with the corresponding `OVModelForXxx` class.
