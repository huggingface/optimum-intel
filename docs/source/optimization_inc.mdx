# Optimization

Optimum Intel can be used to apply popular compression techniques such as quantization, pruning and knowledge distillation. 

## Post-training optimization

Post-training compression techniques such as dynamic and static quantization can be easily applied on your model using our [`IncQuantizer`](https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum/intel_optimization#optimum.intel.neural_compressor.IncQuantizer).
Note that quantization is currently only supported for CPUs (only CPU backends are available), so we will not be utilizing GPUs / CUDA in the following examples.
To apply dynamic quantization on a fine-tuned DistilBERT, we first need to create the corresponding configuration describing the quantization details as well as the quantizer object used to later apply quantization:

```python
from transformers import AutoModelForQuestionAnswering
from neural_compressor.config import PostTrainingQuantConfig
from optimum.intel.neural_compressor import INCQuantizer


model_name = "distilbert-base-cased-distilled-squad"
model = AutoModelForQuestionAnswering.from_pretrained(model_name)
# The directory where the quantized model will be saved
save_dir = "quantized_model"
# Load the quantization configuration detailing the quantization we wish to apply
quantization_config = PostTrainingQuantConfig(approach="dynamic")
quantizer = INCQuantizer.from_pretrained(model)
# Apply dynamic quantization and save the resulting model
quantizer.quantize(quantization_config=quantization_config, save_directory=save_dir)
```


## While training optimization

The [`INCTrainer`] class provides an API to train your model while combining different compression techniques such as knowledge distillation, pruning and quantization.
The `INCTrainer` is very similar to the ðŸ¤— Transformers [`Trainer`](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/main_classes/trainer#trainer), which can be replaced with minimal changes in your code.

```diff
from transformers import TrainingArguments, default_data_collator
-from transformers import Trainer
+from optimum.intel.neural_compressor import INCTrainer
+from neural_compressor import QuantizationAwareTrainingConfig

# Load the quantization configuration detailing the quantization we wish to apply
+quantization_config = QuantizationAwareTrainingConfig()

# The directory where the quantized model will be saved
output_dir = "quantized_model"

-trainer = Trainer(
+trainer = INCTrainer(
    model=model,
+   quantization_config=quantization_config,
    args=TrainingArguments(output_dir, num_train_epochs=3.0),
    train_dataset=train_dataset,
    eval_dataset=eval_dataset,
    compute_metrics=compute_metrics,
    tokenizer=tokenizer,
    data_collator=default_data_collator,
)

# Save the PyTorch checkpoint
+trainer.save_model()
```

For pruning, we support snip_momentum(default), snip_momentum_progressive, magnitude, magnitude_progressive, gradient, gradient_progressive, snip, snip_progressive and pattern_lock. You can refer to [the pruning details](https://github.com/intel/neural-compressor/tree/master/neural_compressor/pruner#pruning-types).
> **_Note:_** At present, neural_compressor only support to prune linear and conv ops. So if we set a target sparsity is 0.9, it means that the pruning op's sparsity will be 0.9, not the whole model's sparsity is 0.9. For example: the embedding ops will not be pruned in the model.

For distillation, we support knowledge distillation, intermediate layer knowledge distillation and self distillation. You can refer to [the distillation details](https://github.com/intel/neural-compressor/blob/master/docs/source/distillation.md)

## Loading a quantized model

To load a quantized model hosted locally or on the ðŸ¤— hub, you must instantiate you model using our [`INCModelForXxx`](https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum/main/intel/reference_inc#optimum.intel.neural_compressor.quantization.INCModel) classes.

```python
from optimum.intel.neural_compressor import INCModelForSequenceClassification

model_name = "Intel/distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english-int8-dynamic"
model = INCModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(model_name)
```

You can load many more quantized models hosted on the hub under the Intel organization [`here`](https://huggingface.co/Intel).

## Inference with Transformers pipeline

The quantized model can then easily be used to run inference with the Transformers [pipelines](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/main_classes/pipelines).

```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, pipeline

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_id)
pipe_cls = pipeline("text-classification", model=model, tokenizer=tokenizer)
text = "He's a dreadful magician."
outputs = pipe_cls(text)

[{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9880216121673584}]
```
