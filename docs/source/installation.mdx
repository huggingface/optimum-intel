# Installation

To install the latest release of ðŸ¤— Optimum Intel with the corresponding required dependencies, you can do respectively:

| Accelerator                                                                                                            | Installation                                        |
|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:----------------------------------------------------|
| [Intel Neural Compressor (INC)](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/oneapi/neural-compressor.html) | `python -m pip install "optimum[neural-compressor]"`|
| [Intel OpenVINO](https://docs.openvino.ai/latest/index.html)                                                           | `python -m pip install "optimum[openvino,nncf]"`    |

We recommend creating a [virtual environment](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/#creating-a-virtual-environment) and upgrading
pip with `python -m pip install --upgrade pip`.

Optimum Intel is a fast-moving project, and you may want to install from source with the following command:

```bash
python -m pip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/optimum-intel.git
```

or to install from source including dependencies:

```bash
python -m pip install "optimum-intel[extras]"@git+https://github.com/huggingface/optimum-intel.git
```

where `extras` can be one or more of `neural-compressor`, `openvino`, `nncf`.
