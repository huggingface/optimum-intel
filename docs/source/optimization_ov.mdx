# Optimization

ðŸ¤— Optimum Intel provides an `optimum.openvino` package that enables you to apply a variety of model compression methods such as quantization, pruning, on many models hosted on the ðŸ¤— hub using the [NNCF](https://docs.openvino.ai/2022.1/docs_nncf_introduction.html) framework.


## Post-training optimization

Post-training static quantization introduces an additional calibration step where data is fed through the network in order to compute the activations quantization parameters.
Here is how to apply static quantization on a fine-tuned DistilBERT:

```python
from functools import partial
from transformers import AutoModelForSequenceClassification, AutoTokenizer
from optimum.intel.openvino import OVConfig, OVQuantizer

model_id = "distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english"
model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(model_id)
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_id)
# The directory where the quantized model will be saved
save_dir = "ptq_model"

def preprocess_function(examples, tokenizer):
    return tokenizer(examples["sentence"], padding="max_length", max_length=128, truncation=True)

# Load the default quantization configuration detailing the quantization we wish to apply
quantization_config = OVConfig()
# Instantiate our OVQuantizer using the desired configuration
quantizer = OVQuantizer.from_pretrained(model)
# Create the calibration dataset used to perform static quantization
calibration_dataset = quantizer.get_calibration_dataset(
    "glue",
    dataset_config_name="sst2",
    preprocess_function=partial(preprocess_function, tokenizer=tokenizer),
    num_samples=300,
    dataset_split="train",
)
# Apply static quantization and export the resulting quantized model to OpenVINO IR format
quantizer.quantize(
    quantization_config=quantization_config,
    calibration_dataset=calibration_dataset,
    save_directory=save_dir,
)
# Save the tokenizer
tokenizer.save_pretrained(save_dir)
```

The `quantize()` method applies post-training static quantization and export the resulting quantized model to the OpenVINO Intermediate Representation (IR). The resulting graph is represented with two files: an XML file describing the network topology and a binary file describing the weights. The resulting model can be run on any target Intel device.


## Training-time optimization

Apart from optimizing a model after training like post-training quantization above, `optimum.openvino` also provides optimization methods during training, namely Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) and Joint Pruning, Quantization and Distillation (JPQD).


### Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) 

QAT simulates the effects of quantization during training, in order to alleviate its effects on the model's accuracy. It is recommended in the case where post-training quantization results in high accuracy degradation. Here is an example on how to fine-tune a DistilBERT on the sst-2 task while applying quantization aware training (QAT).

```diff
import evaluate
import numpy as np
from transformers import (
    AutoModelForSequenceClassification,
    AutoTokenizer,
    TrainingArguments,
    default_data_collator,
)
from datasets import load_dataset
- from transformers import Trainer
+ from optimum.intel.openvino import OVConfig, OVTrainer, OVModelForSequenceClassification

model_id = "distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english"
model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(model_id)
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_id)
# The directory where the quantized model will be saved
save_dir = "qat_model"
dataset = load_dataset("glue", "sst2")
dataset = dataset.map(
    lambda examples: tokenizer(examples["sentence"], padding=True), batched=True
)
metric = evaluate.load("glue", "sst2")

def compute_metrics(eval_preds):
    preds = np.argmax(eval_preds.predictions, axis=1)
    return metric.compute(predictions=preds, references=eval_preds.label_ids)

# Load the default quantization configuration detailing the quantization we wish to apply
+ ov_config = OVConfig()

- trainer = Trainer(
+ trainer = OVTrainer(
    model=model,
    args=TrainingArguments(save_dir, num_train_epochs=1.0, do_train=True, do_eval=True),
    train_dataset=dataset["train"].select(range(300)),
    eval_dataset=dataset["validation"],
    compute_metrics=compute_metrics,
    tokenizer=tokenizer,
    data_collator=default_data_collator,
+   ov_config=ov_config,
+   task="sequence-classification",
)

# Train the model while applying quantization
train_result = trainer.train()
metrics = trainer.evaluate()
# Export the quantized model to OpenVINO IR format and save it
trainer.save_model()

# Load the resulting quantized model
- model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(save_dir)
+ model = OVModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(save_dir)
```


### Joint Pruning, Quantization and Distillation (JPQD)

Other than quantization, compression methods like pruning and distillation are common in further improving the task performance and efficiency. Structured pruning slims a model for lower computational demands while distillation leverages knowledge of a teacher, usually, larger model to improve model prediction. Combining these methods with quantization can result in optimized model with significant efficiency improvement while enjoying good task accuracy retention. In `optimum.openvino`, `OVTrainer` provides the capability to jointly prune, quantize and distill a model during training. Following is an example on how to perform the optimization on BERT-base for the sst-2 task.

First, we create a config dictionary to specify the target algorithms. As `optimum.openvino` relies on NNCF as backend, the config format follows NNCF specifications (see [here](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/nncf/tree/develop/docs/compression_algorithms)). In the example config below, we specify pruning and quantization in a list of compression with thier hyperparameters. The pruning method closely resembles the work of [Lagunas et al., 2021, Block Pruning For Faster Transformers](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.04838.pdf) whereas the quantization refers to QAT. With this configuration, the model under optimization will be initialized with pruning and quantization operators at the beginning of the training.

```python
compression_config = [
    {
        "compression":
        {
        "algorithm":  "movement_sparsity",
        "params": {
            "warmup_start_epoch":  1,
            "warmup_end_epoch":    4,
            "importance_regularization_factor":  0.01,
            "enable_structured_masking":  True
        },
        "sparse_structure_by_scopes": [
            {"mode":  "block",   "sparse_factors": [32, 32], "target_scopes": "{re}.*BertAttention.*"},
            {"mode":  "per_dim", "axis":  0,                 "target_scopes": "{re}.*BertIntermediate.*"},
            {"mode":  "per_dim", "axis":  1,                 "target_scopes": "{re}.*BertOutput.*"},
        ],
        "ignored_scopes": ["{re}.*NNCFEmbedding", "{re}.*pooler.*", "{re}.*LayerNorm.*"]
        }
    },
    {
        "algorithm": "quantization",
        "weights": {"mode": "symmetric"}
        "activations": { "mode": "symmetric"},
    }
]
```

> Known limitation: Current structured pruning with movement sparsity only supports *BERT, Wav2vec2 and Swin* family of models. See [here](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/nncf/blob/develop/nncf/experimental/torch/sparsity/movement/MovementSparsity.md) for more information.

Once we have the config ready, we can start develop the training pipeline like the snippet below. Since we are customizing joint compression with config above, notice that `OVConfig` is initialized with config dictionary (JSON parsing to python dictionary is skipped for brevity). As for distillation, users are required to load the teacher model, it is just like a normal model loading with transformers API. `OVTrainingArguments` extends transformers' `TrainingArguments` with distillation hyperparameters, i.e. distillation weightage and temperature for ease of use. The snippet below shows how we load a teacher model and create training arguments with `OVTrainingArguments`. Subsequently, the teacher model, with the instantiated `OVConfig` and `OVTrainingArguments` are fed to `OVTrainer`. Voila! that is all we need, the rest of the pipeline is identical to native transformers training.

```diff
- from transformers import Trainer, TrainingArguments
+ from optimum.intel.openvino import OVConfig, OVTrainer, OVTrainingArguments

# Load teacher model
+ teacher_model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(teacher_model_or_path)

- ov_config = OVConfig()
+ ov_config = OVConfig(compression=compression_config)

trainer = OVTrainer(
    model=model,
+   teacher_model=teacher_model,
-   args=TrainingArguments(save_dir, num_train_epochs=1.0, do_train=True, do_eval=True),
+   args=OVTrainingArguments(save_dir, num_train_epochs=1.0, do_train=True, do_eval=True, distillation_temperature=3, distillation_weight=0.9),
    train_dataset=dataset["train"].select(range(300)),
    eval_dataset=dataset["validation"],
    compute_metrics=compute_metrics,
    tokenizer=tokenizer,
    data_collator=default_data_collator,
+   ov_config=ov_config,
    task="sequence-classification",
)

# Train the model like usual, internally the training is applied with pruning, quantization and distillation
train_result = trainer.train()
metrics = trainer.evaluate()
# Export the quantized model to OpenVINO IR format and save it
trainer.save_model()
```

## Inference with Transformers pipeline

After applying quantization on our model, we can then easily load it with our `OVModelFor<Task>` classes and perform inference with OpenVINO Runtime using the Transformers [pipelines](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/main_classes/pipelines).

```python
from transformers import pipeline
from optimum.intel.openvino import OVModelForSequenceClassification

model_id = "helenai/distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english-ov-int8"
ov_model = OVModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(model_id)
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_id)
cls_pipe = pipeline("text-classification", model=ov_model, tokenizer=tokenizer)
text = "He's a dreadful magician."
outputs = cls_pipe(text)

[{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9840195178985596}]
```
