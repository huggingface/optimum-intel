# IncTrainer

The `IncTrainer` class provides an API to apply compression techniques such as knowledge distillation, pruning and quantization while training the model.

Those compression techniques can be combined easily with our `IncTrainer` which possess a similar behavior than the [`Trainer`](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/main_classes/trainer#trainer) of Transformers:

```diff
-from transformers import Trainer
+from optimum.intel.neural_compressor import IncTrainer

-trainer = Trainer(
+trainer = IncTrainer(
    model=model,
    args=training_args,
    train_dataset=train_dataset,
    eval_dataset=eval_dataset,
    compute_metrics=compute_metrics,
    tokenizer=tokenizer,
    data_collator=data_collator,
)
```
