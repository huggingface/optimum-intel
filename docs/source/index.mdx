# 🤗 Optimum Intel

🤗 Optimum Intel is the interface between the 🤗 Transformers and Diffusers libraries and the different tools and libraries provided by Intel to accelerate end-to-end pipelines on Intel architectures.

[Intel Neural Compressor](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/oneapi/neural-compressor.html) is an open-source library enabling the usage of the most popular compression techniques such as quantization, pruning and knowledge distillation. It supports automatic accuracy-driven tuning strategies in order for users to easily generate quantized model. The users can easily apply static, dynamic and aware-training quantization approaches while giving an expected accuracy criteria. It also supports different weight pruning techniques enabling the creation of pruned model giving a predefined sparsity target.

[OpenVINO](https://docs.openvino.ai) is an open-source toolkit that enables high performance inference capabilities for Intel CPUs, GPUs, and special DL inference accelerators ([see](https://docs.openvino.ai/2024/about-openvino/compatibility-and-support/supported-devices.html) the full list of supported devices). It is supplied with a set of tools to optimize your models with compression techniques such as quantization, pruning and knowledge distillation. Optimum Intel provides a simple interface to optimize your Transformers and Diffusers models, convert them to the OpenVINO Intermediate Representation (IR) format and run inference using OpenVINO Runtime.
