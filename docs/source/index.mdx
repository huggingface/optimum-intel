# ðŸ¤— Optimum Intel

ðŸ¤— Optimum Intel is the interface between the ðŸ¤— Transformers library and the different tools and libraries provided by Intel to accelerate end-to-end pipelines on Intel architectures.

[Intel Neural Compressor](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/oneapi/neural-compressor.html) is an open-source library enabling the usage of the most popular compression techniques such as quantization, pruning and knowledge distillation. It supports automatic accuracy-driven tuning strategies in order for users to easily generate quantized model. The users can easily apply static, dynamic and aware-training quantization approaches while giving an expected accuracy criteria. It also supports different weight pruning techniques enabling the creation of pruned model giving a predefined sparsity target.

[OpenVINO](https://docs.openvino.ai/latest/index.html) is an open-source toolkit that enables high performance inference capabilities for Intel CPUs, GPUs, and special DL inference accelerators. It is supplied with a set of tools to optimize and quantize models. Optimum Intel provides a simple interface to optimize Transformer models, convert them to OpenVINO Intermediate Representation format and to run inference using OpenVINO.

## Installation

ðŸ¤— Optimum Intel can be installed using `pip` as follows:

```bash
python -m pip install optimum[intel]
```

Optimum Intel is a fast-moving project, and you may want to install from source.

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/optimum-intel.git
```
